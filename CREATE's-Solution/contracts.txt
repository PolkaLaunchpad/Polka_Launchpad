CREATE2 Not Functional on Polkadot Westend. Create Workaround?

Using CREATE and the associated contracts in this folder, managed to get a working 'workaround' on EVM, but cannot get it working on PolkaVM - Transaction execution always reverted, regardless of gas, ED amount, contract logic - Always getting this when using CREATE

Performance Metrics:
Seamless on EVM - Testing on Arbitrum [insert parameters]

Null on Polkadot [Always reverting - see above]

TEST SIMPLEST CASE FOR CREATE
